# Predicting Austin Housing Prices

A machine learning project that predicts Austin, Texas housing prices using multiple regression models and ensemble methods.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes Austin housing market data to build predictive models for property values. The analysis includes comprehensive feature engineering, multiple model comparisons, and ensemble methods to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.

**Key Results:**
- **Best Model**: Ensemble (XGBoost + Random Forest)
- **Performance**: Achieved competitive RMSE on test data
- **Features**: 50+ engineered features including location proximity, property characteristics, and neighborhood intelligence
